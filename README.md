With the help of Python, I dive into NFL free agency a bit early, playing the role of General Manager. Using a bit of web scraping and carefully crafted functions, I identify the teams with the worst offensive and defensive metrics.

By analyzing their deficiencies and salary cap availability, deciding on an ideal player position group for each team only requires a few logical boundaries for the automated free agent picker to come to life. By the end, I've selected 13 player suggestions for 9 NFL teams to target.

Keep in mind that my logic doesn't take into account all that goes into what general managers factor in when signing a player to the roster, i.e., draft prospects, restructured contracts, and the current roster.

Regardless, this was a fun exercise! Especially watching the beginnings of free agency play out in real life and seeing how close my picker was.
